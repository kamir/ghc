        <p>Since <b>Gephi</b> is my tool of choice for graph visualization, and
          Hadoop stores all my data, in HDFS or HBase I created a direct
          connector Hadoop and Gephi. Now all node and edge properties are
          accessable directly, no matter if stored in Hive or HBase tables, via
          Impala we can request the data in <b>SQL-like</b> style. Especially
          time dependent graph data can now efficiently by partitioned
          with Hive and all the large processing is done in Hadoop. Gephi is not
          responsable for the large filter procedures and has only to hold
          in memory what realy has to be shown.</p>
        <p>Using GraphX in the cluster allows even large scale analysis on
          graphs which do not fit into the Workstations memory. After the
          results are available, Gephi loads the relevant nodes and draws nice
          plots.</p>
        <p>But now I have to load data from Hadoop into Gephi. Creation of graph
          files and transfer to the workstation was done regularly.
          I had to repeat this steps manually all the time and important is, to
          remember the parameters which have been applied during processing or
          generation of the graph. This became a critical aspect over time and
          manual handling of all the files was not an option on the long term.</p>
        <p>So I created the <b>Gephi-Hadoop-Connector</b>, which uses the
          JDBC-Interface provided by Impala and Hive, to load edge- and
          node-lists.</p>
        <p>One really important feature in Gephi is: <i>it supports time
            dependent analysis and visualisation of networks.</i>
          To build such a timeline, an individual query can be defined for each
          single time frame of each individual layer.
          If data is already partitioned by time the whole procedure is really
          efficient.</p>
        <p>Finally we have to think about: <i></i>How to handle all this
          metadata of a time dependent multilayer graph? Therefore we use the
          Etosha-Graph-Metastore, which will be released soon.</p>
